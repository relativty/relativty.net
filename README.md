# Why relativty.net? 📖

<p> My name is Hugo Garritsen</a>.  I’m 17 years old and I live in the Netherlands. When I for the fist time found this project on the internet, there was almost no documentation, no social media and no website. So I thought, why not making this, to help the project grow. After having some contact with Maxime, I created this community website!

<p> On this github page, you can report bugs, and do featur requests! I will do my best to keep the website as updated as possible. But this takes time, and hosting also isnt free. So become a patron, to keep the website online, and updated! https://www.patreon.com/relativty </p>
