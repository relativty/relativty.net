# Why relativty.net? ðŸ“–

<p> My name is Hugo Garritsen</a>.  Iâ€™m 17 years old and I live in the Netherlands. When I for the fist time found this project on the internet, there was almost no documentation, no social media and no website. So I thought, why not making this, to help the project grow. After having some contact with Maxime, I created this community website!

# Why wiki.relativty.net? ðŸ“–

<p> Our project is becoming bigger and bigger, so also more and more information will come. Also we needed a good documentation. The only problem was how do you store all this information,make it accessible, and editable for everyone? Well, the most easy solution, and best solution we could think of is a wiki! So on this wiki you can find all the information stored about our project, and if you think we miss some information, or you think some information isnt right, you can edit it! Also on our wiki you can find our documentation, so everyone can edit and translate it.</p>

<p> On this github page, you can report bugs, and do featur requests! I will do my best to keep the website as updated as possible. But this takes time, and hosting also isnt free. So become a patron, to keep the website online, and updated! https://www.relativty.net/campaigns/website/</p>
